# JavascriptAI_HUE_Chatbot_

THIS IS THE BETA VERSION OF THIS PROJECT. THERE IS A 'VERSION 2' REPO. I AM NO LONGER WORKING IN THIS VERSION OF THE HUEAI. <BR>


<strike>A chatbot I made using vanilla Javascript. My plan is to gradually improve its "Intelligence", giving it more diologue options and expand
its ability to communicate back to the user in various ways. I want this to be a program similar to apple's Siri but with more of an emphasis on functionality 
to check in, and initiate meaningful conversations with the user in an effort to improve mental health of its userbase through positive interaction. </strike>
